      <h2>Actually you passed it on the way it goes by the name Osprey. Go back the way you came, 
	  the entrance is on your left. You don't need to go into the house although there is plenty to
	  distract; the lovely volunteer staff who really like to chat. Explore the boardwalk instead,
	  there are three ends that you can be, the Origami Leaves are there for you to see.</h2>
