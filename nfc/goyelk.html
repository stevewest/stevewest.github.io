      <h1>Next Clue</h1>
      <h2>Time to head inland, on a reserve you will soon be, he came some time ago, his name is John Oxley.
	  Again its not far from where you are now, and for those with mouths dry, a drink at the Murrumbah pub would be close by.
	  Enough about rest, it's time to get started and now you need the sign that will get you departed. Her name is Carole Green, 
	  it's her walkway you need to follow, it heads straight down and for most its fairly shallow. The Origami leaves are 
	  waiting for you to spot them, but what would be the point if they weren't at the bottom.
